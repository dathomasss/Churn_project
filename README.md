# Churn_prediction_model
As a Data Analyst  for a retail bank, I was tasked with addressing customer attrition using a dataset of 10,000 clients. The dataset includes demographic details and financial behaviors.
The primary objective was to build a machine learning pipeline to predict which customers are likely to close their accounts. The goal is to identify the largest possible volume of potential churners, minimizing missed detections, to enable proactive retention campaigns.
